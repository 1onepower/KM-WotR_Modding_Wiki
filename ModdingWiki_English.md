# How to use a mod for Pathfinder: Kingmaker or Pathfinder: WotR

### 1. Install [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)

1.1. Download the zip file of Unity Mod Manager from FILES tab in the link above. 

1.2. Extract the zip file. You might need [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). 

1.3. Run UnityModManager.exe. In the rare case it's not responding, try this [new version of .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)

1.4. Select the game name from Game in Unity Mod Manager. In the rare case UMM can't automatically find the game path, select the game path from Folder. The path should look like this: ..\Steam\steamapps\common\Pathfinder Second Adventure

### 2. Install the mod you want

2.1. Get a zip file of the mod. What you need is the compiled release zip but not the source code. If your mod is published on nexus, it should usually be a compiled file. If you're downloading a mod from a Github page, make sure you're downloading from the release page. The link to the release page is on the right of the homepage, choose a version and download the zip named like the mod (but not  Sourcecode.zip)

2.2. Select Mods tab in Unity Mod Manager, drag the zip file of the mod to the Unity Mod Manager window.

2.3. Some mods are not managed by Unity Mod Manager, including: custom portraits, modified localization, save games, or the mod is made using [OwlcatModdingTemplate](https://github.com/OwlcatOpenSource/WrathModificationTemplate), please follow the instructions provided by the mod author.
